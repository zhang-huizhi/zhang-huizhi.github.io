I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Sciences at University of Wisconsin–Madison. I am currently engaged in research across multiple institutions, where I have the opportunity to explore diverse areas within computer science.

At UCLA, I work in the Mobility Lab under the mentorship of Professor [Jiaqi Ma](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/jiaqi-ma/), contributing to research at heterogeneous coorperative perception for autonomous driving.

At UW–Madison, I am a member of the Wisconsin Wireless and Networking Systems Laboratory (WiNGS Lab), led by Professor [Suman Banerjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/), where I focus on object detection in edge-supported augmented reality scenarios.

At UCI, I am involved in research at Ding Lab, advised by Professor [Fangyuan Ding](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/fangyuan-ding), where I work on combining deep learning with GUI tools for cell image segmentation.

These experiences have allowed me to develop a strong foundation in multi-agent perception, augmented reality, and deep learning, and have further sparked my interest in pursuing graduate studies in Computer Science.
