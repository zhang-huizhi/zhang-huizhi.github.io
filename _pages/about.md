I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I am currently engaged in research across multiple institutions, which has allowed me to explore a broad range of topics within computer science.

At UCLA, I work in the Mobility Lab under the mentorship of [Professor Jiaqi Ma](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/jiaqi-ma/), where I contribute to research on heterogeneous cooperative perception for autonomous driving.

At UW–Madison, I am a member of the Wisconsin Wireless and Networking Systems Laboratory (WiNGS Lab), led by [Professor Suman Banerjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/). My work focuses on object detection in edge-supported augmented reality scenarios.

At UC Irvine, I conduct research in the Ding Lab under the guidance of [Professor Fangyuan Ding](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/fangyuan-ding), where I integrate deep learning with GUI-based tools to support accurate cell image segmentation.

In the summer of 2024, I completed an internship at [Hypergryph Network Technology Co.(鹰角网络)](https://www.gryphline.com/en-us/info) where I worked as an algorithm engineer on recommendation systems.

These experiences have helped me build a strong foundation in multi-agent perception, augmented reality, and applied deep learning. They have also further sparked my interest in pursuing graduate studies in computer science.
